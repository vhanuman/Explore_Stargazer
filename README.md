\>\> [**Play now!**](http://vhanuman.github.io/stargazer/app) \<\<




## HOW TO PLAY

* Press **space**, hit the mouse or tap to jump. You need fuel to jump. To recharge, stop jumping and wait for a amount of time.
* Press **M** to mute/unmute the music.
* **Obstacles** spawn randomly. The longer you survive, the faster and more often they spawn.
* **Upgrades** are *green* and *blue stars*, which spawn randomly as well. The longer you survive, the more frequently they spawn.
  * *Green star*: Fuels up jet pack and gives between 50 and 100 extra points.
  * *Blue star*: Gives between 1000 and 2000 extra points.
* If you reach the top, you will lose all your velocity and all your fuel. So don't.
* Keep an eye on your *fuel* level. The less fuel you have, the lower you will jump and the longer delay before recharging.
